先学习这几个函数：
kbhit   //use getch to substitute it.
initgraph

操纵鼠标：
鼠标和键盘是否共用同一个函数操作？   //no
鼠标的坐标怎么表示的？
DOS下面的默认分辨率为80*25

设置中断向量来搞鼠标事件吧   //use teacher's origin code.

先实现键盘的东西    //finished.
搞清楚如何读取组合键 Ctrl+C 这样的   //that's easy.

第一步，先写出正确的makefile并且编译通过
finished.

2nd, finish the drawing part.

figure out the solution of graphics mode.
both graphics and text.

we could put off the implements of highlighting, focus on mouse function first.
READ THE F**K SOURCE CODE!

no textattr are provided, we may need to use asm inline to set text color.
no need. C code can control video memory.

not knowing the basics of DOS4GW, it's hard to use asm, as I don't know if it's real mode or protected mode.

issues:
C-X exiting on changed file results in illegal read CS:IP

using the switch stack code provided by black white
now crash on mouse_up
figuring out the reason of it and the logic of switching
